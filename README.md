# RBAC-java-client
Role-based access control (RBAC) or role-based security is an approach to restricting system access to authorized users. Role-based access control (RBAC) is a policy-neutral access-control mechanism defined around roles and privileges. The components of RBAC such as role-permissions, user-role and role-role relationships make it simple to perform user assignments.
